Subject: [PATCH] CMakeLists.txt: remove signals from find_package() calls to
 support boost 1.69

Deprecated signals library was dropped in 1.69.0 release:
https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_69_0.html

Signals (v1) is now removed. Its removal was announced in 1.68 and its
deprecation was announced in 1.54. Boost 1.68 is the last release that
provides this library. Users are encouraged to use Signals2 instead. The
Boost community thanks Douglas Gregor for his work on Signals which
served its users well and which also inspired Signals2.

It doesn't use signals library at all, this reference in find_package()
was useless and more importantly source of error at configure time.
